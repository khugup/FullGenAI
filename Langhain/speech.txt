A speech essay is a written piece designed to be delivered as a spoken address, blending the structure of an essay with the delivery style of a speech. It aims to inform, persuade, or entertain an audience, requiring the writer to consider how the text will sound when spoken aloud, paying attention to elements like rhythm and emphasis.
